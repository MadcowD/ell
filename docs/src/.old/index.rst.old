Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Prompts as Programs**: ell treats prompts as encapsulated functions rather than simple strings, allowing for more complex and reusable prompt logic.
- **Automatic Versioning and Tracking**: Every change to your Language Model Programs (LMPs) is automatically versioned and tracked, enabling easy inspection and comparison of different iterations.
- **Multimodal Support**: Seamlessly handle text, images, and other modalities in both inputs and outputs.
- **Tool Integration**: Define and use tools within your language model interactions, expanding the capabilities of your LMPs.
- **Structured Outputs**: Generate and work with structured data from language models using Pydantic models.
- ``ell`` **Studio**: Tensorboard for prompt engineering. A open source built-in visualization tool for inspecting your prompts, versions, and invocations.

Design Philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Encapsulation**: Prompts are programs, not strings. ell forces implementers to encapsulate prompt generation in single functions or methods.
2. **High-Quality Tooling**: Prompt engineering deserves the same high-quality tooling and design patterns as machine learning engineering.
3. **Efficient Iteration**: Every call to a language model is valuable. ell provides tools for versioning, tracing, and analyzing prompt iterations.
4. **Real-World Use Cases**: ell is designed for complex, multi-step language model interactions, not just one-shot demos.
