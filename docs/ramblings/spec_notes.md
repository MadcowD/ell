"""
This is the general spec we'd like to use for ell.
Prompts should be functional: 

write_a_story() -> "Some story from GPT4 etc."

Prompts should be serializeable (either automatically or not)


serializer.save(write_a_story, "write_a_story.bin")...


Because prompts are model parameterizations of GPT, and the training process is that of prompt engineering; check pointing should be rigorous and we don't want to rley on git or another vcs to do this..

# I don't like this because the end-user has to recapitulate the chat prompt format if they are intereacting with the model repeatedly. I should be able to in some sense have a format where I don't need to track the history e.g. @ell.chatlm


# we could force the chat components to take as input the history but this is an awkward interface imo.

# What this would do is automatically provide the history from the user in terms of a "Chat prompt" so long as the first param of this user function is a history; or perhaps as lon as they specify as a kwarg this history.

# Okay but now I'm putting on the end user the requirement that they know how to put as a kwarg this history shit..
