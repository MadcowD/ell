# Model Client Resolution

## 1. If its not registered, warn the user that we're going to default to OpenAI.
## 2. If I attempt to define a registered model on a client, & the client specified or the default client doesn't have an API key, warn the user. 
## 3. If I call the the lmp and the whatever client I resolve ot does not have an api key shit ourselves.
