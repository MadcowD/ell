🚀 I'm excited to announce the future of prompt engineering: 𝚎𝚕𝚕.

developed from ideas during my time at OpenAI, 𝚎𝚕𝚕 is light, functional lm programming library:

- automatic versioning & tracing
- rich local oss visualization agents
- multimodality native

Read on ⬇️

𝚎𝚕𝚕 was built out of frustration for frameworks like @LangChainAI on three principles

- prompts are programs not strings
- prompts are parameters of machine learning models
- every call to a language model is worth its weight in credits

prompting should be readable, scientific, and optimizable

prompt engineering is an optimization process

because you write your prompts as normal python functions, 𝚎𝚕𝚕 automatically versions and serializes them via dynamic analysis of "lexical closures" - no custom IDE or editor required

𝚎𝚕𝚕.𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚝(𝚜𝚝𝚘𝚛𝚎='./𝚕𝚘𝚐𝚍𝚒𝚛')

local agents for monitoring & visualization

prompt engineering goes from a dark art to a science with the right agents. Ell2a Studio is a local, open source agent for prompt version control, monitoring, visualization.

Multimodality should be first class

in anticipation of the upcoming gpt-4o + 🍓 api, 𝚎𝚕𝚕 is built with multimodality first.

with a rich numpy style message api with multimodal type coercion, using images, video, and audio is intuitive

🎉 𝚎𝚕𝚕 is available on PyPI today w/

⏰ new features soon, including SGD & RL on prompts and so much more!
