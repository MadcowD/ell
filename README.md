> **IMPORTANT**: This repository is currently pre-v1.0, highly experimental, and not yet packaged for general use. It contains numerous bugs, and the schemas are subject to frequent changes. While we welcome contributions, please be aware that submitting pull requests at this stage is at your own discretion, as the codebase is rapidly evolving.

# What is `ell`?

`ell` is a lightweight, functional prompt engineering framework built on a few core principles:

### 1. Prompts are programs not strings.

Prompts aren't just strings; they are all the code that leads to strings being sent to a language model. In `ell` we think of one particular way of using a language model as a discrete subroutine called a **language model program**.

```python
import ell

@ell.lm(model="gpt-4o")
def hello(world : str):
    """You are a helpful assistant that writes in lower case.""" # System Message
    return f"Say hello to {world[::-1]} with a poem."    # User Message

hello("sama")
```

### 2. Prompts are actually parameters of a machine learning model.

- [ ] Add notes on serialization and lexical closures
      ...

### 3. Every call to a language model is worth its weight in credits.

## Installation

To install `ell`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MadcowD/ell.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```
   cd ell
   ```

3. Install the package using pip:
   ```sh
   poetry install
   poetry run build-hook
   poetry shell
   ```

This will install `ell` and its dependencies, including building the necessary frontend components for `ell-studio`.

Note: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system, as they are required for building the frontend components during the installation process.

## Using `ell-studio`

To visaulize and track your promtps over the course of prompt engineering you need to install a store into your project.

```python

# The entry point to your program
if __name__ == "__main__":

    store = SQLiteStore('sqlite_example') # <---- automatically stores all LMP's invocations, and version history in a sqlite database in ./sqlite_example
    store.install(autocommit=True) # <---- installs the store into your project so that tracking happens and change log commit messages are automatically generated using gpt-4o-mini

    your_language_model_program()
    print(greeting[::-1])

```

Now you can visualize your prompt engineering process just like tensorboard by using `ell.studio`:

```
python3 -m ell.studio --storage-dir ./sqlite_example
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see your prompt engineering process visualized.

## Contributing

To contribute, install `ell` in development mode using:

```
poetry install
poetry shell
```

To run `ell-studio` you must seperately run the backend and the front-end. To start the front-end:

```
cd ell-studio
npm run dev
npm run start:dev
```

To start the backend:

```
python -m ell.studio --storage-dir ./sqlite_example --dev # the dev flag is important!
```

You can then visualize your promtps by visiting the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`


## v1 release todos
- LMP UX Finished entirely
- Postgres backend
- Clean all of the pydantic schema serialziation santiziation etc that we do throughout the codebase
- Full version history UX
- Package on pypy
- Docs 
- Jupyter compatability
- Tests
- Convert all of our todos into issues and milestones
- Multimodality
- Output parsing.

## Todos

### Metrics

- [ ] Design the metrics functionality. (maybe link WandB lol)

### Bugs

- [ ] Fix weird rehashing issue of the main prompt whenever subprompt changes? Or just make commits more of a background deal.
- [x] Trace not writing on first invoc.
- [ ] Serialize lkstrs in the jkson dumps in pyhton the same way as the db serializers them for the frontend (\_\_lstr vs SerialziedLstr) <- these are pydantic models and so we can reuse them
- [ ] handle failure to serialize.
- [ ] Unify cattrs deserialziation and serialization its fucked right now.
- [ ] Fix URL not changing on invocation click

## Tests

- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for all core functionalities.
- [ ] Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows.
- [ ] Optimize backend performance and run benchmarks.

## Trace Functionality

- [x] Visualize trace in graph
- [x] Implement Langsmith-style invocations and traces
- [x] Improve UX on traces
- [o] Complete full trace implementation on invocation page
- [x] Enhance UX around traces in dependency graphs
- [o] Implement argument pass-through functionality
- [ ] Working trace graph thing

## Ell Studio
- [ ] Optimize front-end data fetching & api structure
- [ ] Add websockets for live updates.
- [ ] Add a section for the actual LLM call

## Version History

- [x] Auto-document commit changes
- [x] Implement version history diff view (possibly with automatic commit messages using GPT-4)
- [ ] Add interactive diff view
- [ ] Highlight changes in source when switching versions
- [ ] Automatically format python code on serialization (version doesnt change just because formatting does.)

## Caching and versioning

- [x] Get caching to work for bound global mutable types
- [x] Decide if version not change just because I invoke an LMP using a global that was mutated some where else in the program. (In example where we had test being global with a list of objects of type Test) that shouldn’t change the version number. My vote is that it shouldn’t change.
- [x] Bind global mutable at invocation, and update our Invocation database types
- [x] Come up with a nice way to expand and collapse stored globals in dependency scope.disc
- [x] Serialize globals free variables at time of definition
- [x] Come up with a nice way to display bound globals of an invocation
- [x] Custom syntax highlighting for these bound mutable objects
- [x] When we click invocation, the global if its overridden at the time execution needs to be updated.
- [x] Decide where the line between program state and program version changes. If we had a global variable which was a list of [“asd”]*10000 do we include the contents of this shit in the version.

- [ ] Better definition disclosure (and hiding) for bound global variables
- [ ] Design or steal vs-code’s debug instance widget
- [ ] Bind all arguments to their names in the function signature (pre v1)
- [ ] Compute type lexical closures as needed (post v1)

## LM Functionality

- [x] Freezing and unfreezing LMPs
- [ ] Support multimodal inputs
- [ ] Implement function calling
- [ ] Add persistent chatting capability
- [ ] Integrate with various LLM providers

- [ ] Create examples for tool use and agents
- [ ] Demonstrate Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning
- [ ] Showcase optimization techniques

## Store

- [ ] Improve developer experience around logging mechanisms
- [ ] Drastically improve query runtime and performance test.

## DX (Developer Experience)

- [x] Enhance UX for the LMP details page
- [ ] Improve layout for the differnet parts
- [ ] Add Dependency Graph on LMP page
- [ ] Implement VSCode-style file explorer
- [ ] Ensure and test Jupyter compatibility
- [ ] Continue UI/UX improvements for the visualization component
- [x] Update LMP Details to be function-based for easier result viewing
- [ ] Implement easy navigation similar to VSCode (cmd+shift+p or spotlight)
- [x] Optimize display of dependencies on prompt pages

- [ ] Automatic API key management if not specified as a nice experience. Should ask for the api key and store it in the ~/.ell/api_keys directory for the user's convenience.
- [ ] Need a cli for managing api keys etc

## Packaging

- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [x] Prepare package for distribution
- [ ] Refine and organize examples
- [x] Create production build for ell studio
- [ ] Draft contribution guidelines
- [ ] Document the code


## Misc
