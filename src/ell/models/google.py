"""
This module handles the registration of Google Gemini models within the ell framework.

It provides functionality to register various Google Gemini models with a given Google Gemini client,
making them available for use throughout the system. The module also sets up a default
client behavior for unregistered models.

Key features:
1. Registration of specific Google models with their respective types (system, google, google-internal).
2. Utilization of a default Google client for any unregistered models,

The default client behavior ensures that even if a specific model is not explicitly
registered, the system can still attempt to use it with the default Google client.
This fallback mechanism provides flexibility in model usage while maintaining a
structured approach to model registration.

Note: The actual model availability may depend on your Google account's access and the
current offerings from Google.

In this file, we use google's openai compatible client to perform the registration.
